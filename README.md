===============

This is a demonstration plugin that will contain all program functionality for a 'how to build a wordpress based university website' tutorial series.

The first post covered setting up a custom post type, and a taxonomy.
The custom post type is hierarchical, so posts can have child posts. This will come in handy later when we set up conditions that will make specific options available to root level parent posts. 

The taxonomy comes with prepackaged with three default terms. There is also a capability role assigned so only an administrator can ad new terms to the taxonomy.
